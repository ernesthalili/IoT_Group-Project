# Smart Irrigation

## Definition 
The product created is a Smart Irrigation System for plants using Temperature, air humidity, soil humidity sensors and it is connected to the Internet. The system provides the user with automatic actions through 2 actuators. In every case, there is a display showing the level of the soil humidity using colours to show the state of the system. If the level of humidity is high enough, we show the value using a green value, for lower values we use orange colour and for states where the humidity level is very low, the value is read. When the system is in danger state, a pump is used to irrigate water.

## Objective
The project has as an objective to develop a web application, in which users can interact with the environment by turning off/on the system. All the values of the sensors are displayed to the users. Apart from the automatic actions done by the system, the user has the possibility to turn off/on the pump. This is provided for extreme/unconsidered cases that could happen

### Storyboard
**Person1** + **Scenario1** + **Mission1**

Carlo's garden is large and he needs at least 5 people to work there to maintain the plants in good condition. Not all gardeners are experienced enough and sometimes the plants do not take the necessary amount of water. By using this product, Carlo needs only to assume 1 gardener, Filiberto to take care of his plants. Since water is a fundamental resource, he also tries not to waste water unnecessarily. Now, he can use our service to monitor the condition of the soil and the environment to avoid as much water waste as possible and allow the plant to grow normally with the correct amount of water. So, Mr Carlo will be happy to pay the water bill and will have some very healthy grown plants.
