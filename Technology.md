## Smart Irrigation System
This component is the main part of our system. The main purpose is to **irrigate the necessary amount of water** to the plants. When the level of the soil moisture is decreased in a critical state, the **Soil moisture sensor(Adafruit Seesaw)** provides this value to the central unit which activates the **pump of water(Submersible Water Pump)**. For every read of the sensors, all the data is sent to the server using the **wifi connection**. Instead on the **OLED display** we will show the last value read by the sensor. All the sensors and actuators are controlled by a **Nucleo Board(stm32-f401re)** with **RIOT Operating System**.

## Web Dashboard
It is the highest level component of our system, composed of a **remote server**(AWS and NodeJS are used) and a **frontend page**(HTML, Bootstrap, javascript) where data will be displayed for the user. All the data the system takes from the sensors are stored in a **DynamoDB**.
