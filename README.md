## Main Idea

**Safety Floater** is a smart floater with the purpose to detect the **illegal transit** of the **boats** near by swimmers, in order to preserve the safe distance. This system allows to the authorities to monitor coasts and tourists' welfare. At the same time, Safety Floater allows achieve another goal in an indirect way: improve the water pollution near the coast.

In future, the system could be used to monitor the state of the sea and to improve the prevention of the illegal traffic of boats by installing a camera in order to get a photo of who break the rules.
