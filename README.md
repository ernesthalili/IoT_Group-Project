## Main Idea

"Smart Irrigation" is a smart system with the purpose to optimize the usage of water for the irrigation of plants. This system allows people to monitor the growth of plants in small environments. At the same time, by using the correct quantity of water we are also improving the growth of plants.

In future, the system could be extended from small plants located in jars into a wider environment like farms or rural areas.
